TODOs in no specific order:

technisch:

fachlich:
- epg overview: implement alarm
- epgsearch view: save and use templates
- wake on lan
- epg view: favourite channel list
- channel config view: save and load configuration


TODOs which are not yet reasoned:

- implement SVDRP-only VDR plugin to get more information / do something useful
    e.g. - get list of deleted recordings / undelete recordings
- implement svdrp server to show jonglisto OSD entries:
    e.g. - favourite channel list
         - epg suggestions (together with an epg search mechanism)
- automatically change epg-data (that search timers are able to filter) -> But how to prevent epgd to change the epg entry?
- channel configuration view: is it possible to update the channel list in live/running vdr?


finished TODOs:

- channel configuration view: hide all epgd information, if epgd is not configured
- main page: ping and svdrp only after requested, not automatically
- timer page: show timer conflicts and timeline => sorted by transponder
- epg details view: record, switch channel, find reruns, create searchtimer
- recording view: show free/used harddisk size
- channel logos
- play video in recording view
- OSD view is not implemented
- change channel logo creation (logo as theme component(?), not as logo.jar anymore). This is a performance issue.
- Fix logging (either parent-last in tomee or use the tomcat logging)
- if parent-first is still used, then some libraries are not used anymore
- monitor open VDR connections (i'm not sure if everything is working as desired)
- more rights / better password configuration (use e.g. a hashed value)
