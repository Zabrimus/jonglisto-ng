TODOs in no specific order:

technisch:

fachlich:

- epgsearch view: save and use templates
- channel config view: save and load configuration
- rename recording directories
- configurable epg search view (more powerful shortcut to the existing epg search)
- mark epg entries if a timer exists (in any VDR)
- mark epg entries if an alarm exists


TODOs which are not yet reasoned:

- automatically change epg-data (that search timers are able to filter) -> But how to prevent epgd to change the epg entry?

finished TODOs:

- channel configuration view: hide all epgd information, if epgd is not configured
- main page: ping and svdrp only after requested, not automatically
- timer page: show timer conflicts and timeline => sorted by transponder
- epg details view: record, switch channel, find reruns, create searchtimer
- recording view: show free/used harddisk size
- channel logos
- play video in recording view
- OSD view is not implemented
- change channel logo creation (logo as theme component(?), not as logo.jar anymore). This is a performance issue.
- Fix logging (either parent-last in tomee or use the tomcat logging)
- if parent-first is still used, then some libraries are not used anymore
- monitor open VDR connections (i'm not sure if everything is working as desired)
- more rights / better password configuration (use e.g. a hashed value)
- epg view: favourite channel list
- epg overview: implement alarm
- channel favourite list can be shown in VDR using vdr plugin osdserver
- possibility to select the desired locale as URL parameter
- epg images
- upgrade to vaadin 8.3
- get list of deleted recordings (in vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- undelete recording (in vdr-plugin-jongslisto)
- wake on lan
- implement svdrp server (currently used by vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- channel configuration view: update channel list live/running vdr (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- disable login if configured and add an url parameter for the desired user
- timer view which also shows remote timers (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
