0.2.0-snapshot:
Bugfixes:
- delete multiple recordings could destroy the internal tree data structure
- more useful notification if VDR is not running or cannot be reached
- strange validation errors while creating new epgsearch timers

New:
- dropped support for osdserver
- optional dependency vdr-plugin-jonglisto (version 0.1.0)
- additional attribute in VDR configuration (mac), used for WOL (wake on lan)
- wake on lan implemented
- svdrp server implemented (used by vdr-plugin-jonglisto). Most commands tries to determine the calling VDR, which must be
     configured in jonglisto-ng. If the VDR cannot be found, the command fails.
     jonglisto-ng understands the following commands
        PING (same as VDR)
        QUIT (same as VDR)
        FAVL <svdrpPort> (returns the configured channel favourites for the calling VDR)
        FAVC <name> (returns the configured channel ids in favourite list <name>)
        EPGT (returns the configured epg time list)
        ALRM <svdrpPort> <time> <channelid> <title> (sets an alarm timer at <time>, on <channelid> with title <title>, VDR listens on <svdrpPort>)
        ALRL <svdrpPort> (returns all Alarms for the VDR listen on <svdrpPort>)
        ALRC toggle <id> (switch on/off, alarm with id <id> returned by ALRL)
             delete <id> (delete alarm with <id> returned by ALRL)
        VDRL (lists all configured VDR)
        VDRD <name> (show details of the VDR with name <name>)
        VDRP <name> (pings the VDR with name <name>)
        VDRW <name> (sends Wake on lan to VDR with name <name>, if MAC is configured)
- update channel list in live/running VDR (in channel configuration, needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- visibility of favourites in VDR OSD can be configured for each VDR
- possibility to bypass login and use the Username defined as URL parameter (needs configuration in security.ini and jonglisto-ng.xml)
- timer view shows also remote timers (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- timer view shows if a timer is created by epgsearch, epgd or epg2timer, also shows if this is a timer from plugin RemoteTimers
- update/delete remote timers (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- create remote timer (if SVDRPDefaultHost is configured in VDR, needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- tools under configuration implemented (it's unsure, if someone else could or will use it, mainly used for development)
  copy epg and channel data from one VDR to another one
- rename recording directory implemented

0.1.0:
Bugfixes:
- accidentally use only german locale, now other (english currently exists) languages are working.
- create channels.conf

New:
- new optional dependency: vdr plugin osdserver (see http://www.udo-richter.de/vdr/osdserver.html)
- show favourite channel list of jonglisto-ng in VDR OSD (needs osdserver plugin)
    - shows the different lists
    - shows program on channel
    - shows epg information
    - set timer, alarm or switch channel
- epg alarm message using osdserver implemented
- configurable time before or after event start to fire the alarm job
- URL parameter 'locale=de' or 'locale=en' are supported to choose another locale (other language files currently do not exists). Normally the browser locale is used.
- optional dependency to vdr plugin jonglisto (https://github.com/Zabrimus/vdr-plugin-jonglisto) to get extended epg information and images.
- new optional configuration elememt <scraper></scraper> which could be set, if extended EPG information and/or images shall be shown.
- scraper images and informations can be displayed (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- channel switch in channel configuration (it's easier to sort channels, if the channel can be switched on VDR)
- replaced TwinColSelect in favourite configuration with an own component. TwinColSelect has too many disadvantages.
- show deleted recordings (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)
- undelete recording (needs vdr-plugin-jonglisto)

0.0.3:
Bugfixes:
- exception in channel configuration, if no channel groups are defined
- empty epgsearch view (but only if epgd is not configured. Reason: nonsense condition in the code)
- tried to fix too small column in timer view for date, time and duration
- click on channel in epg view shows all events for this channel
- initial timer sorting by date/time
- fixed time selection in epg view

New:
- channel favourites (configuration)
- cron-like jobs are available (shell script calls or svdrp commands), also used for epg alarm
- channel favourites can be used in epg view to filter the channel list
- build image is available at dockerhub: docker pull zabrimus/jonglisto-ng. This results in much faster subsequent builds.
- runtime image which contains Apache TomEE and jonglisto-ng 0.0.3 is available at dockerhub: docker pull zabrimus/jonglisto-ng-runtime (see documenation in the main page)
- epg alarm button implemented (osd message, channel switch, custom SVDRP command)
- new permission view:configuration:favourite:all
- new permission view:configuration:favourite:user
- new permission view:configuration:jobs:all
- new permission view:configuration:jobs:user
- new permission view:configuration:jobs:shell <-- not yet used
- new permission view:configuration:jobs:svdrp
