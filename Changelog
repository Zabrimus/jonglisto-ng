0.0.3 (not yet published):
Bugfixes:
- exception in channel configuration, if no channel groups are defined
- empty epgsearch view (but only if epgd is not configured. Reason: nonsense condition in the code)
- tried to fix too small column in timer view for date, time and duration

New:
- channel favourites (configuration)
- channel favourites can be used in epg view to filter the channel list
- new permission view:configuration:favourite
- build image is available at dockerhub: docker pull zabrimus/jonglisto-ng. This results in much faster subsequent builds.
